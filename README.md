This repository contains materials for "The Trickling Up of Excess Savings" (Auclert, Rognlie, Straub 2023, forthcoming AEA P&P). You can [download it as a zip by clicking here](https://github.com/shade-econ/trickling-up/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

The main content is in the Jupyter notebook `trickling up model.ipynb`, which performs all calculations in the paper to generate Figure 4 and Table 1. You can easily edit this notebook to do new simulations with your own parametersâ€”for instance, by editing the parameters for the main calibration in cell 4.

Note that the extensions of the baseline model rely on the support file `ct_re_solver.py`, which is a simple linear rational expectations solver in continuous time.

The `replication` folder contains all figures from the paper and also a `Figure1.ipynb` notebook, which uses data from the `Data` subfolder to generate our motivating Figure 1 on excess savings.
